        Cap&apos;s Store offers a two-year manufacturer warranty on all
        products. Refurbished products purchased from authorized retailers are
        covered by a one-year manufacturer warranty. If you believe your product
        is faulty and is within the warranty period, please fill out the form
        from &apos;Support&apos; section to submit a warranty claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you&apos;ve completed and submitted the warranty claim form our
        customer service team will proceed with your claim within two business
        days. If you are required to return your product prior to approval, you
        will receive an email with a prepaid return shipping label. Please do
        not mail your product to us without a prepaid return label provided by
        Cap&apos;s Store as this will delay the claims process.
      </p>
      <p>
        If no further information is needed, you&apos;ll receive an approval
        confirmation email, followed by a shipping confirmation email with a
        tracking number for your replacement product once they have been
        shipped. Please do not discard your faulty product until you receive
        your replacement.
